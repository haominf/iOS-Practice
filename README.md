# iOS-Practice

Here are some iOS applications (more to be added) that I made for fun during my free time.
####The Bull’s Eye Game: the objective of the game is to put the bull’s eye, which is on a slider that goes from 1 to 100, as close to a randomly chosen target value as you can. The closer you put, the higher you score.
####The Checklists: to be finished soon

All apps are made with Apple’s Swift 3.0 programming language and Xcode IDE, through a series of tutorials from iOS Apprentice book, available at www.raywenderlich.com (Copyright ©2016 Razeware LLC.).
